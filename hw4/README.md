## key point
### Introduction of spatial domain edge detection
**Spatial domain edge detection** involves applying convolutional filters directly to pixel values to detect intensity changes that signify edges. This project implements two common edge detection methods:

- **The Sobel filter** computes image **gradients** to highlight edges, with the 0¬∞ kernel detecting vertical edges and the 90¬∞ kernel detecting horizontal edges.

- **The Laplacian filter** is a rotation-invariant **second-order derivative** filter that highlights edges by measuring intensity differences from neighboring pixels, commonly using 4- or 8-neighbor kernels.

If the image contains noise, the Sobel or Laplacian filter may enhance the noise, since both are sensitive to **high-frequency components**.
